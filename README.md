# YUMHUB - <i>Food Stall Application</i>
The food industry has experienced significant growth and transformation in recent years, driven by changing consumer preferences and advancements in technology. However, small-scale food stall owners often face numerous challenges in managing their orders and analyzing their profits due to limited resources, infrastructure, and technological capabilities. These limitations hinder their ability to effectively compete with larger establishments and optimize their business operations.<br><br>
To address these challenges, we have undertaken the development of a web-based application that aims to provide small food stall owners with a comprehensive solution for order management and profit analysis. The application leverages modern web technologies to create a user-friendly and intuitive platform that empowers food stall owners to efficiently manage their orders, track sales, and gain valuable insights into their business performance.<br><br>
The primary objective of this project is to develop a cost-effective and accessible solution that caters specifically to the needs of small food stall owners. By implementing this application, we aim to streamline their order management processes, enhance their decision-making capabilities, and ultimately improve their overall profitability.<br><br>
In this report, we will provide a detailed account of the project's objectives, methodology, implementation, and key features. Additionally, we will highlight the potential benefits this application offers to small food stall owners, including increased efficiency, improved customer satisfaction, and data-driven decision-making.<br><br>
Through the development and implementation of this web-based application, we envision enabling small food stall owners to compete effectively in the dynamic food industry, while empowering them to achieve their business goals and drive sustainable growth.
